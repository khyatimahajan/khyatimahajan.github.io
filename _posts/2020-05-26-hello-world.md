Hello
======
Welcome to my very first post on my website. I have been working on creating an academic website for a very long time. This forked website was taken from <https://academicpages.github.io>, and the instructions were crystal clear to follow. Any personal changes you want to make are nicely placed in folders beginning with an underscore. I would highly recommend this Github repo for anyone who wants to setup quickly and with ease :)

World
======
My world in the times of COVID19 has focussed on reading a lot. Living through a global pandemic has been an interesting experience. I have been awed and perplexed by the complex behaviors exhibited by the human species in this time. Hope we understand each other more in the coming times, and above all, be kind.
