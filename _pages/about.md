My interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing, now commonly known as GenAI. I hold a PhD in the field from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My projects are available on my [Github](https://github.com/khyatimahajan). Learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khyati-mahajan).
