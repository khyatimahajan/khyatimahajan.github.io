I'm a PhD student studying human behavior. I like researching collective behavior and gaining insights into human reactions, especially during crises events + teaching machines to converse with humans meaningfully. I am also interested in how we use emojis to communicate :)

I am also studying opinions expressed online through social media using computational social science methods and NLP as a part of a multi-phase interdisciplinary project at UNC Charlotte. I have also worked on identifying hate speech, and am now working on identifying hope speech on social media.

I'm a Graduate Life Ambassador (2020-2021) at UNC Charlotte, and am an active founding member of the Club for AI Research. Definitely [join us](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/organization/cair) if you are looking to discuss topics related to Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
